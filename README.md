# Welcome to Lighthouse BnB!

LighthouseBnB is a web application designed to revolutionize the travel industry by allowing homeowners to rent out their properties to travelers. It provides an alternative to traditional hotels and bed & breakfasts, making it easier for people to book unique accommodations.

This project is part of my learnings within the Web Development Flex Program at Lighthouse Labs.


## About the Learning
The purpose of this project is to design a database and use server-side JavaScript to display the information from queries to web pages. The main goal is to apply our existing knowledge of complex SQL queries, database and ERD (entity relationship diagram) design to integrate the database with a Node backend: 


- Explain the importance and application of SQL/relational databases for web applications.
- Describe the key components that make up a relational database.
- Design database tables using primary and foreign keys correctly.
- Determine if a data model should use one-to-many or many-to-many relationships when designing relational databases.
- Utilize SELECT statements to solve common data query questions involving GROUP BY, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER.
- Utilize CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE statements to modify existing database table structure and records.
- Use JOIN statements to combine information from related tables to build more complex result sets.
- Use asynchronous (promise-based) postgres JS libraries to query data from Node applications.
- Use the psql CLI to interact with and explore a database.
- Research database queries through documentation and other references.

## Getting Started
* Create a new repository using this repository as a template.
* Clone your repository onto your local device.
* CD into the LightBnB_WebApp directory
* Install dependencies using the npm install command.
* Start the web server using the npm run local command. 
  The app will be served at http://localhost:3000/.
* Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

### Dependencies
* bcrypt: Used for password hashing and security.
* cookie-session: Manages user sessions using cookies.
* express: A web framework for building the Node.js server.
* nodemon: Automatically restarts the server on file changes (development tool).
* pg: PostgreSQL client for interacting with the database.
